# React + Vite

This project is a simple, fast, and responsive contact management web app built using React + Vite.
It provides an easy way to store, organize, and manage contact information with an intuitive user interface.
Users can add, edit, search, sort, and delete contacts in just a few clicks.
The app also includes smart validation — it checks for duplicate contacts and ensures phone numbers have exactly 10 digits before saving.

The layout is designed to be fully responsive, adapting smoothly to both desktop and mobile screens.
A soothing blue gradient theme adds a modern and clean touch to the overall look of the application.
